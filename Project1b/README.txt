For Phase B, the only file that must be committed is Vector.h. You may add
or modify additional files at your own discretion. You can modify
the gtest unittests however you see fit, but note that the tests are designed
so that your Phase B solution should still pass all the Phase A tests.

When we grade your project, we will use our own test files
and we will #include "Vector.h". You must ensure that any code (template
definitions) we need are included by just the one line #include "Vector.h"

Good Luck!

*****************************************************************************
FOR LINUX USERS:
We have provided only one Makefile for this portion of the project - one that
supports gtest.

type "make" to build the test executable with gtest
type "make test" to build & execute the test executable
